### Required Packages
The Python packages NumPy, pandas, re, Matplotlib seaborn, statsmodels, and scikit-learn were all used for analysis. NumPy, pandas, and re were utilized for reading in the data, numerical analysis, aggregation measures, and data cleaning. Matplotlib and seaborn were utilized to create exploratory graphs and heatmaps for correlation amongst variables. Finally, statsmodels was used to build a linear redgression and scikit-learn was used to develop, train, and assess our Naive Bayes and Random Forest models that we used.
